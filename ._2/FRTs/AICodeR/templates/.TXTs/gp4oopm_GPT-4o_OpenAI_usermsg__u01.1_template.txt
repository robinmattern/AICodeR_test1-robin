I want you to create an web apps that use JavaScript ES6, that uses `import`, not `require`, and the native `fetch`.

For the backend please use NodeJS version 20+ and scripts with a .mjs extension.
Put the client scripts in a client folder e.g. `client/index.html` and server scripts, `.env` and `package.json` in a server folder e.g. `server/server.mjs`.
In `server.mjs`, display "Client is running at http://localhost:${PORT}" for the `app.listen()` command.
When importing javascript files use the filename and extension.

Display your response as a MarkDown. For each script provide the filename preceded by "### File: ".
On the next line show the code between ``` marks indicating the language. After the code write an explanation of what the code does.

Please provide a diagram of the folder structure followed by instructions for installing node modules and for executiing the client and server apps.
Provide debugging instructions for the server app assuming we currently have a `lauch.json`, and Chrome's DevTools for the client apps.
For these instructions provide a heading of "### Instructions: ".

Use this to create an application that allows the upload of .ics file then use it as a prompt
