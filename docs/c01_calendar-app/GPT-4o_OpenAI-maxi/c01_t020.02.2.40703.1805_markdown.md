"To get your application running smoothly, follow the comprehensive instructions regarding installation, execution, and debugging given above. Below, I'll provide more depth on some steps and essential highlights to ensure everything is covered.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n\n1. **Open Project Folder in VSCode**:\n   - First, navigate to your project directory in the terminal:\n     ```sh\n     cd path/to/project-folder\n     ```\n   - Open VSCode in that directory:\n     ```sh\n     code .\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Node Modules**:\n   - Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 20+).\n   - In the terminal within VSCode, run:\n     ```sh\n     npm init -y\n     npm install express multer node-fetch\n     ```\n\n3. **Update `package.json`**:\n   - Your `package.json` should now have the necessary dependencies and script configurations.\n\n4. **Launch Configuration in VSCode**:\n   - Ensure you have the `launch.json` file setup in the `.vscode` folder.\n   - This configuration allows you to debug the server by pressing `F5` and selecting the \"Launch Server\" configuration.\n\n5. **Serve Static Files and Start Server**:\n   - Use the `npm start` script or the VSCode debugger to start your server.\n     ```sh\n     npm start\n     ```\n\n6. **Use Live Server for Client**:\n   - Install the \"Live Server\" extension in VSCode to serve your `client/index.html`.\n   - Right-click on `index.html` and select \"Open with Live Server‚Äù.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Security**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is securely handled and not exposed in the client-side code.\n- **File Handling**: Monitor and manage the `uploads` directory to handle temporary files appropriately.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error checks and handling both in your server and client scripts.\n\nBy confirming each part of the setup and code functions correctly, you should have a fully operational application ready for further expansion and testing.
